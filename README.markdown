PySlayer
-----------------------------------------------

PySlayer is a clone of [dbslayer](http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer) but in Python supporting(only MySQLdb tested) all DBAPI compatible drivers

Why does it exist?
------------------

Because dbslayer doesn't work in Windows and compiling it with cygwin was painful and unsuccesful

Installing
----------

PySlayer is avaliabe in PyPI,just run:
    sudo pip install pyslayer


How do I use it?
----------------

The API is very simillar to [dbslayer](http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer/wiki/DbslayerCommands)

only the DB endpoint is implemented.
